# A clever hack to implement 1D cellular automata in the fastest, easiest way possible.
![](rule102.png)
## what are we going to do?
follow a reproducible process to implement a cellular automaton

### what is a "rule"? what does rule '102' means?
explain how rules are encoded, truth table

### how are automata usually implemented from the truth table
lookup from table for single bit

## how they can be implemented better and how it goes from O(n^2) to O(n)
bitwise logic operations on the whole row shifted by one or itself + python demonstration
(useful in low level languages)

### easy RISCV assembly implementation + python renderer from numbers + mention to OEIS sequence database
