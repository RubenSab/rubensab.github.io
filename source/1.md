*^ generated with rule 102 automaton*

# What is a cellular automaton?

A cellular automaton is a collection of **cells**, usually arranged in a **grid** (2D automata) or a **line** (1D automata), where cells **change state** (0 or 1) all at once, following a simple specified **rule set** based on the state of **neighbouring cells**.

A complex **self replicating** system emerges from simple rules.

The concept of **cellular automata** was developed by the mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists **John von Neumann** and **Stanislaw Ulam** in the 1940s while working on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, then it was expanded further in the 1970s by the work of **John Conway**, who invented the famous **Conway's Game of Life** (see the GIF above) which you can try [here](https://copy.sh/life/), and by **Stephen Wolfram** in the 1980s.

# Naive implementation of 1D automata

Every automaton can be implemented easily with the same process, but let's say that we want to implement the **rule 102** one.

First of all, what does rule 102 even mean? It's a **rule set** that considers every possible situation in which a cell could be in a moment and computes its **next state**.

![rule 102](1_imgs/rule102.png)

Let's see: **for every cell in the line** we can say that a **cell** and its **left/right neighbours** can be either 0 or 1, so there are 2^3 = **8 possible combinations** of these three. Every combination can result in the cell changing its state to 0 or 1, so we can start writing a **truth table**, considering the current states of left/central/right cells as **inputs**, and the next state of the central as the **output**.

```
L = left cell
C = central cell
R = right cell
C' = C next state

L C R | C'
0 0 0 | ?
0 0 1 | ?
0 1 0 | ?
0 1 1 | ?
1 0 0 | ?
1 0 1 | ?
1 1 0 | ?
1 1 1 | ?
```

102 is simply a compact way to express every output (C') mapped to every input configuration (L C R): in binary 102 is 01100110, so we write it in the truth table from top to bottom.

```
L C R | C'
0 0 0 | 0
0 0 1 | 1
0 1 0 | 1
0 1 1 | 0
1 0 0 | 0
1 0 1 | 1
1 1 0 | 1
1 1 1 | 0
```

To make a **naive implementation** in our programming language of choice, we could:

1. **Loop** on every cell of the **current line**
	1. get its left-right-center configuration and the output mapped to it on our **look-up table**,
	2. insert the new computed state inside of **new line**'s corresponding position.
2. Print the new line and consider it as the current one, repeat the process until reaching the desired number of iterations.

This process has complexity O(n^2) because we iterate for n lines on n cells (considering a square grid).

# Is there a cleaner, better way to do it?

Of course!

Notice that we apply the **same rule set to every cell** in the current line, so there must be a way to apply it **all at once**, provided that we find:

- a way to encode the rule set with **boolean logic**,
- the **array of right neighbours of every cell** (spoiler: we won't need the array of left ones)

## Transforming the table into a logic operation

Notice that the output is 1 if and only if the **central cell** and the **right neighbour cell** are in a different state; the left neighbour cell doesn't play a role.
This is, by definition, the logic operation of **exclusive or** (XOR) between right and central cell.

> Note: we found by chance an exceptional rule set that reduces to a simple logic **operator**, but even if the majority of rule are not that simple to reduce, they can still be expressed by a logic **expression**, made out of multiple operators.

## Right neighbouring cells

The *array of **right** neighbours of every cell* can be made by shifting the line of cells to the **left** by one position.

## New algorithm

Now we have every ingredient to get from computing the **single cells** to computing **whole rows** instantly:

1. print the current line,
2. shift the current row of cells by one to the left,
3. set the current row to (*itself* XOR *itself shifted by one to the left*)
4. repeat until reaching the desired number of iterations.

The complexity went from O(n^2) to O(n), isn't that amazing?
### Python Implementation

``` python
cells = 1 # initial configuration = 0000...001
for i in range(64): # repeat 65 times
	print("{:064b}".format(cells)) # print cell row (64 bits) in binary
	cells = cells ^ (cells << 1)
```

```
output:
