In this short guide I'll explain how near-infrared photography works and how to enjoy this cool technique yourself.

# Why take photos in infrared?

Infrared has some very interesting properties:

Plants, grass and trees **glow bright** in warm or ghostly colors against the background.

People appear as if they were made of smooth **wax** and have visible black veins.

**Fog disappears** almost completely, so far away mountains will have the same detail as near objects.

# What does infrared mean?

> Many of us have seen *heat images* made by **thermal cameras**, which can detect **medium and long infrared waves** (a huge range of wavelengths), but that is **not** the type of infrared we are talking about.

In the context of **infrared photography**, we deal only with ***near infrared waves***, a type of light with wavelengths just a bit longer than visible light, ranging from roughly 700 to 1000 nanometers (*for context, visible light goes from 380 to 700 nm*)

Think of infrared as a **hidden color** to explore that lies **just beyond the visible spectrum**, one we can't see with the naked eye.

# How cameras can see IR just fine, but unmodified ones filter it out

A **camera sensor** can capture a **wider range of light** compared to our eyes, but in normal cameras there are some glass layers just above it that **filter** "unwanted" wavelengths. As a result, cameras produce images that are very similar to what we see.

## IR conversion

To make infrared images, it's necessary to remove the **IR-cut filter**.

This process is called **infrared conversion** and you can either do it yourself following tutorials (very unsafe), paying companies like [Kolari Vision](kolarivision.com) to do it (very expensive) or **buy online already converted old cameras** (cheaper and safer).

## Full spectrum vs IR only

After a **conversion**, your camera captures **both visible and infrared light**. This is called **full spectrum** photography.

It produces surreal color combinations: **yellow/orange foliage in daylight**, and **purple hues during sunset**.

Most photographers prefer to screw an **IR-pass filter** (typically 720 nm) **on the lens**, which **blocks visible light** and **lets only infrared light through** the sensor.

This produces proper **infrared only** photos.

## How do IR photos appear

When you take a ~720 nm Infrared only photo without adjusting white balance, you get a heavily red-tinted image where you can't quite tell the colors apart.

If you **fix white balance** (better if done in the camera itself) most of this reddish tint will go away, and you'll be left with a nearly grayscale image with a twist, where all **plants**, paints and materials that **reflect infrared** will be **bright blue/purple**.

Infrared is shown as blue because cameras assign the color blue to **both** **true blue light** and to **infrared wavelengths**.

# Getting blue skies and pink/red leaves

The palette of unedited IR photos isn't always that great, with blue trees and yellow skies in the day (using a ~720 nm filter).

A possible solution is to **swap RGB channels** to BRG, so red becomes blue, green becomes red and blue becomes green.

You can do it online on websites like [ConvertCase](https://www.convertcase.com/image/swap-rgb-channels) or [PopArtStudio](https://www.popartstudio.nl/effect.aspx?lang=0&user=&help=0&scrolltop=1&effect=SwapBRG).

> If you can't find a way to swap RGB channels in your software, be aware that the BRG swap is ***the same as shifting the image hue by +120Â°*** (one third of the color wheel).

In this way, **plants** will become **pink** and the **sky** will be tinted of a pleasing **cyan**/light blue color.
