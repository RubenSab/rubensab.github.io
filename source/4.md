Some times ago, while designing a custom [CPU emulator](https://github.com/RubenSab/Zedecim-ISA-emulator), I stumbled into a math problem: I needed to pick **random whole numbers** in **any given range** using only a (boolean) value that can casually become 0 or 1 if asked.

Think of this random, two-sided value as a **coin** that can be tossed on its head (1) or tail (0), and imagine ranges from 0 to n as an n+1 sided **dice**.

This simplification works because extracting a casual number from 20 to 25 can be thought as extracting it from 0 to 5 and adding a fixed offset, like 20 in this case.

# First attempt, coin tosses as increments

Let's try to simulate a classic **six sided dice**. Could we toss **5 coins** and take the **number of heads +1** to get numbers from 1 to 6?

I tested this approach with one million "dice" made like this and this is the result:

Clearly the **distribution** of outcomes is **uneven** (and it can be proven to be *binomial*).
We should have expected this because if we toss 5 coins, according to the rule we chose, there happens to be:

- only one way to get **1** (all heads),
- 5 ways to get **2** (every combination with 1 head and 4 tails),
- 10 ways to get **3** (every combination with 2 heads and 3 tails),
- 10 ways to get **4** (every combination with 3 heads and 2 tails),
- 5 ways to get **5** (every combination with 4 head and 1 tails),
- only one way to get **6** (all tails).

# Another approach, coin tosses as choices

If a coin toss is a **casual fair choice between heads or tails** (2 possible states), how can we extend this perfect fairness to more possible states, so more possible **numbers**?

Suppose we need to pick a number between 0 and 7 (8 sided dice).
The idea is simple, we can **chain choices** like this:

```
       1°       first toss, we choose either [0,1,2,3] or [4,5,6,7] 
      / \
     /   \
    /     \
   2°      2°   second toss, we can choose [0,1] or [2,3], [4, 5] or [6, 7]  
  / \     / \
 3°  3°  3°  3° third toss, we choose 0 or 1, 2 or 3, 4 or 5, 6 or 7
/ \ / \ / \ / \
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (final states)
```

This is a **binary tree**, because we start from the initial range, then we can **branch left or right** at every step in our path, finally reaching a number.

A **path in a binary tree is equivalent to a number** written in binary, because 0 can be thought as *right* and 1 as *left*, so we can **treat coin tosses as binary digits** to get a random number.

With this very efficient process we **halve the number of choices left to make** every time we make one (**logarithmic growth** of choices as the number of final states grows).

## There's a problem

As it is, we can only have dices whose number of faces is a **power of two**.

For example, to simulate a 6 sided dice, we can **toss 3 coins** like before, as 2^3 (8) is the smallest power of two larger than 6, and **repeat** if the result is larger than 5.

There's **no way around it** without increasing the amount of coins used or having a biased distribution.

In the worst case, the number of **dice rolls rejected** tends to **50%**.

This isn’t as bad as it looked on paper: in a million dice rolls, **99%** of rolls produced a valid number after **6 retries or fewer**, **90% within 3 retries**, and **50% after just 1 retry**.

This shows that the method is not only **elegant** and **simple**, but also surprisingly **efficient**.
