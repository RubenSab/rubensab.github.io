        <p>
            I noticed that the flash of the instax Mini 41 was too strong for indoor
            or dim light conditions, so I 3d printed two filters made of translucent white
            Sunlu PLA+, varying in thickness (0.8mm and 2.4mm), and a completely black one.
        </p>

        <p>
            I tried painting the white filters with markers. Here are some comparisons:
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/comparison1.jpg" alt="no filter, 0.8, 2.4, blue">
        <p>
            The 0.8mm filter is a good compromise between <b>detail</b> and <b>fidelity</b>
            in the rendition of colors, that's because the 2.4mm filter rendered the colors
            even more faithfully to those seen by the eye, but completely lacked details on the leaves.
            The blue colored filter turned out to be far dimmer than my expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here I tried the black filter too: I really appreciate the more <b>dramatic and
            gloomy</b> effect that the total absence of a flash gives off.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the orange filter matched my expectations being only slightly
            warmer than the white one.
