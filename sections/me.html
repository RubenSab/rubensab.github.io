	  <h1>About me and this site</h1>
	  <p>
	    I'm Ruben Sabatini, an undergraduate CS student from Rome.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I wanted a personal, independent space (a "sandbox") where I could safely collect my programming <a href="projects/projects.html">{ projects }</a>
	    and a bunch of other things, like <a href="posts/posts.html">{ interesting concepts I stumbled upon or tinkered with }</a>
	    and <a href="photography/photography.html">{ photos }</a>,
	    away from the big and greedy social media platforms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    So I made this website that (now) I can truly call my own.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Before this one, I already had a "nice" website, but I mostly vibe-coded it with a LLM.
	    Only now, while collecting the few useful scraps of the old site and designing this one, I'm realizing
	    the massive untidiness and short-sightedness lying under the hood of the old one that
	    I've been conditioned to accept in the name of convenience.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In short, <b>make your own things yourself</b>.
