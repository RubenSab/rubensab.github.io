        <p>In this short guide I'll explain how near-infrared photography works and how to enjoy this cool technique yourself.</p>
<h1>Why take photos in infrared?</h1>
<p>Infrared has some very interesting properties:</p>
<p>Plants, grass and trees <strong>glow bright</strong> in warm or ghostly colors against the background.</p>
<p><img alt="pink trees" src="3_imgs/trees.jpg" /></p>
<p>People appear as if they were made of smooth <strong>wax</strong> and have visible black veins.</p>

<p><strong>Fog disappears</strong> almost completely, so far away mountains will have the same detail as near objects.</p>

<h1>What does infrared mean?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of us have seen <em>heat images</em> made by <strong>thermal cameras</strong>, which can detect <strong>medium and long infrared waves</strong> (a huge range of wavelengths), but that is <strong>not</strong> the type of infrared we are talking about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of <strong>infrared photography</strong>, we deal only with <strong><em>near infrared waves</em></strong>, a type of light with wavelengths just a bit longer than visible light, ranging from roughly 700 to 1000 nanometers (<em>for context, visible light goes from 380 to 700 nm</em>)</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.ametek-land.com/pressreleases/blog/2021/june/thermalinfraredrangeblog">image source: ametek-land.com</a></em></p>
<p>Think of infrared as a <strong>hidden color</strong> to explore that lies <strong>just beyond the visible spectrum</strong>, one we can't see with the naked eye.</p>
<h1>How cameras can see IR just fine, but unmodified ones filter it out</h1>
<p>A <strong>camera sensor</strong> can capture a <strong>wider range of light</strong> compared to our eyes, but in normal cameras there are some glass layers just above it that <strong>filter</strong> "unwanted" wavelengths. As a result, cameras produce images that are very similar to what we see.</p>
<h2>IR conversion</h2>
<p>To make infrared images, it's necessary to remove the <strong>IR-cut filter</strong>.</p>
<p>This process is called <strong>infrared conversion</strong> and you can either do it yourself following tutorials (very unsafe), paying companies like <a href="kolarivision.com">Kolari Vision</a> to do it (very expensive) or <strong>buy online already converted old cameras</strong> (cheaper and safer).</p>
<h2>Full spectrum vs IR only</h2>
<p>After a <strong>conversion</strong>, your camera captures <strong>both visible and infrared light</strong>. This is called <strong>full spectrum</strong> photography.</p>
<p>It produces surreal color combinations: <strong>yellow/orange foliage in daylight</strong>, and <strong>purple hues during sunset</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="full spectrum St. Peter, Rome" src="3_imgs/fullspectrum.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>zoom on the distant Basilica of St. Peter at sunset</em></p>
<p>Most photographers prefer to screw an <strong>IR-pass filter</strong> (typically 720 nm) <strong>on the lens</strong>, which <strong>blocks visible light</strong> and <strong>lets only infrared light through</strong> the sensor.</p>
<p>This produces proper <strong>infrared only</strong> photos.</p>
<h2>How do IR photos appear</h2>
<p>When you take a ~720 nm Infrared only photo without adjusting white balance, you get a heavily red-tinted image where you can't quite tell the colors apart.</p>
<p>If you <strong>fix white balance</strong> (better if done in the camera itself) most of this reddish tint will go away, and you'll be left with a nearly grayscale image with a twist, where all <strong>plants</strong>, paints and materials that <strong>reflect infrared</strong> will be <strong>bright blue/purple</strong>.</p>

<p>Infrared is shown as blue because cameras assign the color blue to <strong>both</strong> <strong>true blue light</strong> and to <strong>infrared wavelengths</strong>.</p>

<h1>Getting blue skies and pink/red leaves</h1>
<p>The palette of unedited IR photos isn't always that great, with blue trees and yellow skies in the day (using a ~720 nm filter).</p>
<p>A possible solution is to <strong>swap RGB channels</strong> to BRG, so red becomes blue, green becomes red and blue becomes green.</p>
<p>You can do it online on websites like <a href="https://www.convertcase.com/image/swap-rgb-channels">ConvertCase</a> or <a href="https://www.popartstudio.nl/effect.aspx?lang=0&amp;user=&amp;help=0&amp;scrolltop=1&amp;effect=SwapBRG">PopArtStudio</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can't find a way to swap RGB channels in your software, be aware that the BRG swap is <strong><em>the same as shifting the image hue by +120Â°</em></strong> (one third of the color wheel).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, <strong>plants</strong> will become <strong>pink</strong> and the <strong>sky</strong> will be tinted of a pleasing <strong>cyan</strong>/light blue color.</p>
