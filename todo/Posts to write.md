While reading a short story by the argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges titled "**Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote**", about a *fictional* scholar and his works, I stumbled upon something absurd the main character wrote about chess:

> \[he wrote\] *"a technical article on the possibility of enriching the game of chess by means of eliminating one of the rooks' pawns. Menard proposes, recommends, disputes and ends by rejecting this innovation."*

This "proposal" is simply crazy, one could just laugh and dismiss it as a funny **joke** by the witty Borges; but all of this gave me an **idea**, and it might be not as crazy:

> I started to search for the **fairest** starting position one could get by removing only a pawn from each side.

Pierre Menard only said *"**one of the rooks' pawns**"*, so we can interpret it like **this**, a stupid version where white can start by capturing black's rook right off and start winning:

or (more reasonably) we could see it like **this**:

This is not as absurd as before and actually it could make for a nice asymmetric and **balanced** gameplay!

# Eureka moment ðŸ’¡: in search of a fairer starting position

What if, instead of comparing only "Menard's" setup to the default starting position, we consider ***every*** possible starting position from which we **remove** a white and a black **pawn**, and we find a way to **measure** it's **fairness** compared to the default starting position?

## What does *every position* mean?

Let's say we removed the **sixth** pawn from **white**'s row and the **fourth** one (by our perspective) from **black**'s:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250606220626.png)

For our purposes, we'll call this **position** `(6, 4)`, meaning (6th pawn removed from white, 4th pawn removed from black).

So in our analysis we'll consider every combination `(w,b)` with `w` and `b` ranging independently from 1 to 8, according to the pawn removed.

## Measuring a position's fairness

Isn't it strange to think that it's possible to measure pretty accurately **who's winning** a chess match with just a **number**? The unfathomable complexity of chess would say otherwise.

### Neural network comes to rescue!

Fortunately [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), the strongest chess engine (AI) in the world as of today, has the only two things we need:

- the ability to **evaluate chess positions** with a single number, based on the calculation of (almost) **every possible future opponent move** up to a certain **depth**,
- a very user-friendly **python library** to use it on one's own computer.

### How does **Stockfish** quantify advantage

Loading a chess position into Stockfish is pretty simple, we just need to feed it it's **FEN** (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) which is a **standard format** to tell where the pieces are at (the last example would have this FEN: `rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`).

After the position is loaded, we can make it calculate the advantage with a simple function: we'll get the result in *centipawns*.

**Centipawns** are just "cents of a pawn", so if the position has an **evaluation** of -20, it means as if black had a *fifth of a pawn* of advantage (20/100 pawns) more than white;

the sign tell us who's winning (+ for white and -for black).

We can also **normalize** the **evaluation in centipawns** with the formula of the **curve below** to get the **draw probability** (assuming a "perfect" play), an effective measure of a position's fairness or **balance**.

*draw probability % = 100\*2^(-centipawns/100)^2*

## Visualizing every combination's draw probability

After writing an running the python script for days, I was able to get a general overview of the draw probabilities according to which pawns were removed.


![](draw_probabilities_at_depth_30.png)
I **labeled** the pawns based on **which piece they had behind** for a better visualization.

Notice that **nearly half** (28) of our custom positions are **more balanced than the default** starting one!

> Even one of **Pierre Menard's proposal interpretations** is slightly more balanced, **proving our initial point**!

> However the **two most balanced ones** strike clear with this color palette: `(7, 4)` and `(7, 5)`.

## Two contestants: finding the winner

I made a second script to **test a single position** to a greater depth (40 half-moves in the future rather then 30 like before), and these are the results (in centipawns):

![](single_position_hist_(7,4)_depth_40.png)

![](single_position_hist_(7,5)_depth_40.png)

This is astonishing: position `(7,5)` always gave **0 centipawns** of advantage. Consistently. **FOR 25 TIMES**.

**The winner is clear**, according to **Stockfish**, this is the most balanced starting position you could get by removing a pawn for side and playing without blunders:

It's very interesting to guess why Stockfish chose this setup, but we will only know if we play it!
