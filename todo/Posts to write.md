1. [ ] 3D printing solutions of differential equations
2. [ ] Simulating a small computer and creating a new programming language from scratch with Python

This is not as bad as it looked on paper: for a million dice rolls, 99% of dices shown a valid number after 6 retries, **90% only after 3** and 50% after 1, proving that this is approach is not only very **elegant** and simple, but also very **efficient**.

This isnâ€™t as bad as it looked on paper: in a million dice rolls, **99%** of rolls produced a valid number after **6 retries or fewer**, **90% within 3 retries**, and **50% after just 1 retry**.

This shows that the method is not only **elegant** and **simple**, but also surprisingly **efficient**.
