<h1>What is a cellular automaton?</h1>
<p>A cellular automa is a collection of <strong>cells</strong>, usually arranged in a <strong>grid</strong> (2D automata) or a <strong>line</strong> (1D automata), where cells <strong>change state</strong> (0 or 1) all at once, following a simple specified <strong>rule set</strong> based on the state of <strong>neighbouring cells</strong>.</p>
<p>A complex <strong>self replicating</strong> system emerges from simple rules.</p>
<p><img alt="Game Of Life" src="1_imgs/GOL.gif" /></p>
<p>The concept of <strong>cellular automata</strong> was developed by the mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists <strong>John von Neumann</strong> and <strong>Stanislaw Ulam</strong> in the 1940s while working on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, then it was expanded further in the 1970s by the work of <strong>John Conway</strong>, who invented the famous <strong>Conway's Game of Life</strong> (see the GIF above) which you can try <a href="https://copy.sh/life/">here</a>, and by <strong>Stephen Wolfram</strong> in the 1980s.</p>
<h1>Naive implementation of 1D automata</h1>
<p>Every automaton can be implemented easily with the same process, but let's say that we want to implement the <strong>rule 102</strong> one.</p>
<p>First of all, what does rule 102 even mean? It's a <strong>rule set</strong> that considers every possible situation in which a cell could be in a moment and computes its <strong>next state</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="rule 102" src="1_imgs/rule102.png" /></p>
<p>Let's see: <strong>for every cell in the line</strong> we can say that a <strong>cell</strong> and its <strong>left/right neighbours</strong> can be either 0 or 1, so there are 2^3 = <strong>8 possible combinations</strong> of these three. Every combination can result in the cell changing its state to 0 or 1, so we can start writing a <strong>truth table</strong>, considering the current states of left/central/right cells as <strong>inputs</strong>, and the next state of the central as the <strong>output</strong>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>L = left cell
C = central cell
R = right cell
C&#39; = C next state

L C R | C&#39;
0 0 0 | ?
0 0 1 | ?
0 1 0 | ?
0 1 1 | ?
1 0 0 | ?
1 0 1 | ?
1 1 0 | ?
1 1 1 | ?
</code></pre></div>

<p>102 is simply a compact way to express every output (C') mapped to every input configuration (L C R): in binary 102 is 01100110, so we write it in the truth table from top to bottom.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>L C R | C&#39;
0 0 0 | 0
0 0 1 | 1
0 1 0 | 1
0 1 1 | 0
1 0 0 | 0
1 0 1 | 1
1 1 0 | 1
1 1 1 | 0
</code></pre></div>

<p>To make a <strong>naive implementation</strong> in our programming language of choice, we could:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Loop</strong> on every cell of the <strong>current line</strong><ol>
<li>get its left-right-center configuration and the output mapped to it on out <strong>look-up table</strong>,</li>
<li>insert the new computed state inside of <strong>new line</strong>'s corresponding position.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Print the new line and consider it as the current one, repeat the process until reaching the desired number of iterations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process has complexity O(n^2) because we iterate for n lines on n cells (considering a square grid).</p>
<h1>Is there a cleaner, better way to do it?</h1>
<p>Of course!</p>
<p>Notice that we apply the <strong>same rule set to every cell</strong> in the current line, so there must be a way to apply it <strong>all at once</strong>, provided that we find:</p>
<ul>
<li>a way to encode the rule set with <strong>boolean logic</strong>,</li>
<li>the <strong>array of right neighbours of every cell</strong> (spoiler: we won't need the array of left ones)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transforming the table into a logic operation</h2>
<p>Notice that the output is 1 if and only if the <strong>central cell</strong> and the <strong>right neighbour cell</strong> are in a different state; the left neighbour cell doesn't play a role.
This is, by definition, the logic operation of <strong>exclusive or</strong> (XOR) between right and central cell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: we found by chance an exceptional rule set that reduces to a simple logic <strong>operator</strong>, but even if the majority of rule are not that simple to reduce, they can still be expressed by a logic <strong>expression</strong>, made out of multiple operators.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Right neighbouring cells</h2>
<p>The <em>array of </em><em>right</em><em> neighbours of every cell</em> can be made by shifting the line of cells to the <strong>left</strong> by one position.</p>
<h2>New algorithm</h2>
<p>Now we have every ingredient to get from computing the <strong>single cells</strong> to computing <strong>whole rows</strong> instantly:</p>
<ol>
<li>print the current line,</li>
<li>shift the current row of cells by one to the left,</li>
<li>set the current row to (<em>itself</em> XOR <em>itself shifted by one to the left</em>)</li>
<li>repeat until reaching the desired number of iterations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The complexity went from O(n^2) to O(n), isn't that amazing?</p>
